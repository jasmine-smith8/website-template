== WoMen@HPE STEM website development activity ==

Scenario:

You are a frontend web developer who has been contracted to create a promotional campaign for a subject of your choice. This has no restrictions, but some ideas could include a favourite artist, brand, school subject, hobby, etc. Using what you have learned from your product management session, you should consider your plan, time constraints and priorities, in terms of what you think needs to be included your website. Additionally, you should use the skills from your technical marketing session to consider the use of appropriate styles to accurately represent your chosen subject, in a way that will convey your website well to potential consumers.
