# Week 2: HTML Basics
In this week you will work with HTML. Try completing the following tasks (feel free to get creative and add any personalisation as you go!)

1. Changing The Title:
    - [ ] Find the title text wrapped in a `<h1>` tag and change it.
    - [ ] Change the text below the title to include the name of your school.
  
2. Changing the description:
    - [ ] Change the header of the description section.
    - [ ] Change the description text to include a brief description of what you want.
          
3. Adding an image
    - [ ] Using the `<img>` tag choose one of the images from the Charity Images folder to display below the description.
    - [ ] **Extension 1:** Let's make the image appear in the centre of the page instead. You'll need to add some code to the `styles.css` file.

        (Hint 1) Use the image's `id` attribute to reference it in `styles.css`

        (Hint 2) Try setting the `margin` style. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp) for a tutorial.

4. Changing the chosen charity
    - [ ] Change the 'Charity 2024-25' text to a charity of your choice.
  
5. Adding a hyperlink to charity website
    - [ ] Using the `<a>` tag, add a hyperlink to your chosen charity's website.
