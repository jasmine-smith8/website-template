# Week 1: Setup
See the [setup sheet](https://github.com/trinity-coding-club/website-template/blob/main/GitHub%20Setup%20Sheet.pdf)

# Week 2: HTML Basics
In this week you will work with HTML. Try completing the following tasks (feel free to get creative and add any personalisation as you go!)

1. Changing The Title:
    - [ ] Find the title text wrapped in a `<h1>` tag and change it.
    - [ ] Change the text below the title to include the name of your school.
  
2. Changing the description:
    - [ ] Change the header of the description section.
    - [ ] Change the description text to include a brief description of what you want.
          
3. Adding an image
    - [ ] Using the `<img>` tag choose one of the images from the Charity Images folder to display below the description.
    - [ ] **Extension 1:** Let's make the image appear in the centre of the page instead. You'll need to add some code to the `styles.css` file.

        (Hint 1) Use the image's `id` attribute to reference it in `styles.css`

        (Hint 2) Try setting the `margin` style. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp) for a tutorial.

4. Changing the chosen charity
    - [ ] Change the 'Charity 2024-25' text to a charity of your choice.
  
5. Adding a hyperlink to charity website
    - [ ] Using the `<a>` tag, add a hyperlink to your chosen charity's website.

# Week 3: Gallery Page and CSS Styling

In this session, youâ€™ll learn some basic CSS styling. This week you will work in the gallery page. Have a go at the following tasks: 

1. Changing the background
    - [ ] In the `gallery-styles.css` file, find the `hero-section` selector, and do the following:
        - [ ] Change the `background-color` style, which decides the color of the background
        - [ ] **Extension**: Try adding some CSS to the `hero-section` so that the background is a gradient instead of a solid color. Use [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) for a hint on how to do this.
2. Centre the gallery element
    - [ ] Let's make the slideshow appear in the centre of the page. Add some CSS to the `slideshow-container` to make the slideshow images appear in the middle. For a hint, see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp)
    - [ ] Make sure the dots below the slideshow images are centered too - the CSS code should be similar to the last task, but you'll have to add it to a different selector.
3. Change the image border
    - [ ] Edit the border of the `slideshow` element. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp) for different border options.
4. Make the slideshow bigger
   - [ ] The images are a bit small - can you figure out how to make the slideshow bigger?
5. Change the slideshow images
   - [ ] Back to some HTML - try changing out the default images in the slideshow for some images of your own choice.
  
## Some other ideas for CSS styling
Done with the tasks? Why not try the following to make your website look even better:
- Try changing the font (either for the whole page or only for certain bits such as headings to make them stand out more)
- Try changing the colour of the arrows on the slideshow
- 

# Week 4: Events Section
In this session, we'll work more on other HTML and CSS! This week's focus is the events page. Try to complete the following tasks:

1. Add the listed information to the past events table:
   - [ ] In the events.html file, you will find all of the events in plaintext above the table. You have to:
     - [ ] Create a row for every event entry
     - [ ] Add the appropriate entry to the specific columns
     - [ ] Format the table to what you want! (You can change the dimensions of the table, or the colour of the lines! If you want to add pictures too you can!)
        
2. Create a future events table and come up with innovative charity events to put in it!
   - [ ] Create a new table in the right area, with these headers:
      - [ ] Events
      - [ ] Description
      - [ ] Target Money Raised
   - [ ] Create and fill the table with 3 new events!

3. (EXTENSION) If you've finished all of this early, we can try adding some harder features to this page! You can try:
  - [ ] Fitting both tables side by side: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_table_side_by_side.asp
  - [ ] (DIFFICULT) Trying to fit the tables onto dropdown menus: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp
  - [ ] (DIFFICULT) Adding some javascript for animations (e.g. making the tables spin once when entering the page!)
