    - [ ] Using the `<img>` tag choose one of the images from the Charity Images folder to display below the description.
    - [ ] **Extension 1:** Let's make the image appear in the centre of the page instead. You'll need to add some code to the `styles.css` file.

        (Hint 1) Use the image's `id` attribute to reference it in `styles.css`

        (Hint 2) Try setting the `margin` style. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp) for a tutorial.

# Week 3: Gallery Page and CSS Styling

In this session, youâ€™ll learn some basic CSS styling. This week you will work in the gallery page. Have a go at the following tasks: 

1. Changing the background
    - [ ] In the CSS file, find the `hero-section` selector, and do the following:
        - [ ] Change the `background-color` style, which decides the color of the background
        - [ ] background-image. Here we pass in a linear-gradient function which creates a gradient on the background.
                Here you can change the color of the gradient, as well as its direction. Find out more about gradients <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp">here</a>:
